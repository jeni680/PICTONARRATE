# STORY_GENERATOR

This project accepts a series of user input images and converts them into a story in Malayalam. The process involves extracting captions from the images using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model. These captions are then fed into a story generation model, which generates a story in English. Finally, a translation model is used to translate the generated English story into Malayalam.
